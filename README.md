# Detection Of Circulating Tumor Cells

## Project Summary

**The issue we are hoping to solve**
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) play a critical role in cancer metastasis and are challenging to detect due to their scarcity in the bloodstream. This project aims to develop an efficient, standardized system for analyzing stained blood images to accurately identify and quantify CTCs. 

**Our idea**
Using image segmentation techniques across multiple biomarkers (EpCAM, Hoechst, and CD45), the system analyzes critical features such as brightness and structural similarity to identify and segment potential circulating tumor cell (CTC) images for further evaluation. Additionally, a user-friendly interface is developed to facilitate expert verification of results. This comprehensive approach is designed to enhance clinical support in diagnosing metastatic cancer and informing treatment strategies with improved accuracy and efficiency.  


**Actual integrated image for Analysis**
The image integrates patches segmented from various biomarkers and calculates metrics for analysis. This image is displayed within the project's custom-designed user interface (UI). The UI provides a streamlined platform for healthcare professionals to effectively review and validate potential circulating tumor cell (CTC) images identified by the system. Its intuitive design enables clinicians to save time while ensuring accuracy in their evaluations, ultimately facilitating better decision-making.
